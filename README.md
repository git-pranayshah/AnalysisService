# Microsoft Azure Analysis Services with Sample Data on Azure SQL
Microsoft Analysis Services is a Platform As a Service (PaaS) service within Microsoft Azure under Business Intelligence umbrella. It brings Build rich semantic models with the capability of gaining insight at the speed of thought. Itâ€™s a proven technology on cloud with capability of provisioning and scaling with ease. There are two options to start play around with the Analysis services. 

1.  Create Sample Model directly in the Service
2.  Create Azure SQL with Sample Data and build the model from scratch with that data 

We will going to see both the options with this ARM template so that you can kickstart deploying & playing with the service with Sample (Sales Data) data.

# Azure Analysis Service with Azure SQL Landing Zone

To work with Azure SQL we need landing zone template having Azure Vnet, Private Endpoint, Azure SQL Server & Database. Combination of all the services will allow us to deploy Azure SQL with Sample Database with right network and security configuration to access the data. 

On other hand, Azure Analysis services does not need any specific network installation. It works as a standalone service in Azure with On-Premise Data gateway which needs to be configured separately on the client system where we need to develop the model before deploying it to the Azure Cloud

# Landing Zone Architecture

The [Template.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git-pranayshah/AnalysisService/master/template.json) Azure Resource Manager template will help you automatically deploy the diagram below, which includes:

- A landing zone for network with,
    Virtual Network
    Two Subnet (Default & Private-Data)
    Network Interfaces to connect to Private Network
    Private Network Links
- Azure SQL Server with,
    Sample Dataset (Please verify Pricing Tier as it contributes to cost)
    Private Network Link Connection
- Analysis Services Instance

- A Network Security Group with the necessary outbound rules for Azure Virtual Desktop Hostpools to properly activate and work.
- All services are ready to communicate with client Ip which is used to configure the service. In case of firewall error, request you to verify you client Ip under firwall section
- Cost implications are involved with Azure SQL and Analysis Services instance. Review and modify the Pricing Tier based on your needs
